# LaserGuardJS

An academic test in building HTML5 games using the canvas + vanilla javascript.

### How to run

Start a web server and point it to the web `index.html`. You can do this with `PHP` like so...

```
$ cd web/
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

This will create a server at `localhost:8080` that you can visit in your browser.
